# CalculatorProject
Calculator
This project is a simple calculator that can perform arithmetic calculations on two operands. The program takes user input as expressions containing two numbers separated by an operator. The calculator then computes the expression and displays the result.

Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the program. You will be prompted to enter an expression containing two operands separated by an operator. The calculator will then compute the expression and display the result. If an error occurs during the calculation, an error message will be displayed instead of the result.

The following operators are supported by the calculator:

+ - addition
- - subtraction
* - multiplication
/ - division
v - square root
| - absolute value
s - sine
c - cosine
t - tangent
The calculator also supports the "quit" command, which can be used to exit the program.

Testing
This project includes a testing feature. To run the tests, call the testCalc method in the Main class. The testCalc method reads a list of expressions and expected results from a file and runs each expression through the calculator. If the calculator returns the expected result for each expression, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.
